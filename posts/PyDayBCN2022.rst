Lightning talk at PyDayBCN2022
==============================

During the `PyDayBCN2022 event
<https://pybcn.org/events/pyday_bcn/pyday_bcn_2022/>`_, I gave a lightning talk
to illustrate the possible uses that `Astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_ can
have in other fields. I finally decided to place the talk as a post entry to
learn how to integrate slides into a web page using the
`Jupyter nbconvert <https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ tool.

   This presentation was originally placed as a standalone page. Moved to a blog post
   entry. It is a little bit outdated now, but I decided to leave the
   presentation as it was given.
