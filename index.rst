   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Learning by doing
-----------------

It is well known that the best way to master a subject is by using it in
practice. The main purpose of this personal page is to have some fun
developing code and, at the same time, delve into some topics that I would
normally not be able to use in my day to day. Obviously, a website also needs
to have some content. So, it is also possible that I explain some things that I
couldn't find elsewhere, or that I consider to be insufficiently detailed. For
example, :ref:`what_is_a_support_astronomer`

If you like what I explain, or you simply want to know more about me, you can
contact me using the links to the social media at the top of this page. I look
forward to hearing from you.

.. `toctree` directive, below, contains list of non-post `.rst` files.
   This is how they appear in Navigation sidebar. Note that directive
   also contains `:hidden:` option so that it is not included inside the page.

   Posts are excluded from this directive so that they aren't double listed
   in the sidebar both under Navigation and Recent Posts.
